      <h2>Our History</h2>
      <p>The Lamberton Church of Christ was born out of a series of tent revivals in the late teens and early 1920's. Lamberton Church of Christ was formed around 1923 when our current church building was purchased.</p>
      <p>
        Beginning in 1952 the Lamberton Church of Christ called Homer Dobson and his wife Better to serve as pastor and they served until 2010. Fifty-eight years of faithful service after which their son Tom Dobson served as pastor until 2016. Pastor Dave
        and Heather Birch arrived in May 2016.

      <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
      <p>
        Lamberton Church of Christ shares a heritage with what is known as "The Restoration Movement". Several phrases describe this mid 1800's church planting movement; such as "No creed but Christ, no book but the Bible" and "In essentials unity, non-essentials
        liberty and in all things charity". Many different churches carry a similar heritage as the Restoration Movement which spread throughout the Midwest and Western states.
