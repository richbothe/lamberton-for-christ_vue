              <p>We are a Christ centered, Bible believing, independant fellowship located in beautiful downtown, metropolitan Lamberton Minnesota.</p>
              <p>Our purpose is to know Him and make Him known. Clear systematic Bible preaching and teaching is our highest priority. We recognize that no other foundation will stand the test of time and eternity.</p>
              <p>Our fellowship has a small town friendliness and feel. Come as you are but we hope you do not leave as you were. We strive to leave the imprint of Jesus upon all we meet.</p>
